Version 1.0.5
-Added fields 'md_date_value' and 'md_date_check' to the 'tmr_main_data' table. 
 For work with this fields need 2 actions:
  1. Add the fields on page 'admin/transfer-meter-readings/settings/fields';
  2. On page 'admin/transfer-meter-readings/settings' check one of the checkboxes "Show date of transmission of recent readings" and "Show date of calibration of meter".
-Added ability to hide of column with personal account number;
